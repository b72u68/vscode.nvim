# vscode.nvim

A plugin to make you stop using Neovim and use VSCode instead.

> Forgive me, Neovim god. For the sins I have ~~git~~ committed

## Installation

If your friend is using Neovim, quickly put them to sleep and break into their computer.

Then put this in their config file:

- Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

  ```viml
  Plug 'b72u68/vscode.nvim'
  ```

- Using [dein](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)

  ```viml
  call dein#add('b72u68/vscode.nvim')
  ```

Watch them suffer and slowly convert to using VSCode.

## Usage

You don't. Stop using Neovim and use VSCode instead.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcomed. Please include a proof that you make the changes
in VSCode, not Vim or Neovim, in your PR.

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out how to remove this plugin because it keeps opening VSCode and
      blocking me from using Neovim

- [ ] Download more RAM to use VSCode

- [ ] I don't know what more to add to this plugin

- [x] ~~Function to forced download VSCode even if you don't want to~~
